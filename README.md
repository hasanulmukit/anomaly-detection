# Anomaly Detection in Blockchain Transactions

It is an integrated framework designed for detecting anomalies and fraudulent activities in blockchain transactions using deep autoencoder architectures. By leveraging advanced regularization techniques and adaptive thresholding, this app learns the normal patterns of blockchain data and flags deviations that may indicate fraud.

## Features

- **Deep Autoencoder Architecture:**  
  Learns the complex non-linear patterns in blockchain transactions.
  
- **Advanced Regularization:**  
  Uses dropout layers to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

- **Adaptive Thresholding:**  
  Dynamically sets the anomaly detection threshold based on reconstruction error statistics.

- **Synthetic Anomaly Injection:**  
  Supports evaluation with synthetic anomalies to simulate fraudulent activities.

- **Interactive Dashboard:**  
  Includes a Streamlit-based dashboard for real-time monitoring and anomaly visualization.
